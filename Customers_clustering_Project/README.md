In this doc, i try to made some clustering costumers using machine learning based on `CUST_ID, BALANCE, BALANCE_FREQUENCY, PURCHASES, ONEOFF_PURCHASES, INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES, CASH_ADVANCE, PURCHASES_FREQUENCY, ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY, PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY, CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY, CASH_ADVANCE_TRX, PURCHASES_TRX, CREDIT_LIMIT, PAYMENTS, MINIMUM_PAYMENTS, PRC_FULL_PAYMENT, TENURE`. i am using KMeans method from https://scikit-learn.org to find the predicted classification.
