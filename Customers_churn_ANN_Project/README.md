# Cursomers churn using ANN method Project

In this doc, i try to made some deep learning prediction how machine can classify the costumers churn using Artificial Neural Network method from https://www.tensorflow.org/ to find the predicted classification.

## Dataset

i am using 3rd party dataset which go by name `churn.csv`. the table description were like this.

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `user_id` | ID of a customer |

## Goal

The goal i had are able to achive predicted classification with accuracy score 0.83 and deploy the model on hugginface
