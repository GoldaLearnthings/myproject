# Death_prediction_Project
In this doc, i try to made some predicted classification how machine can classify if the person were gonna died based on `age, anaemia, creatinine_phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection_fraction, high_blood_pressure, platelets, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, sex, smoking, time, DEATH_EVENT`. i am using ` RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier` methods from https://scikit-learn.org and `xgboost` method from https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html to find the predicted classification.

## Dataset

I used dataset from 3rd party which they dont want to publish it.

## Goal

The goal i had are able to achive predicted classification with Accuracy score `o.8` and then publish it on hugginface
